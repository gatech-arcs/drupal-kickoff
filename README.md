## Drupal Recipes
[Drupal Recipes](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/recipes) are a way to define a set of modules and configuration that can be installed with a single command. This project calls recipes for installing common configuration and modules to allow lifecycle adaptation without being pinned to a specific base profile.
