Composer and initial configuration starting point for GT College of Sciences Drupal projects, based on minimal or no installation profile and then mixing in recipes.

## Drupal Recipes

[Drupal Recipes](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/recipes) are a way to define a set of modules and configuration that can be installed with a single command. This project calls recipes for installing common configuration and modules to allow lifecycle adaptation without being pinned to a specific base profile.

[Applying Recipes](https://www.drupal.org/project/distributions_recipes)

## Will call

- gt/sso
- gt/theme -- modified from IC's GT theme
- gt/compat -- to help with compatibility from campus profiles
